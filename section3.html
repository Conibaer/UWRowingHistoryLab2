        During the 1935-36 season an underdog Varsity crew was formed. These 9 rowers were each born out of the unique hardships 
        created by the great deppression in the decade beforehand. Most came with rather humbel origins, all from small logging, 
        farming, or mining towns scattered across the state of Washington. The crew came together to beat Cal in the annual duel 
        race, win IRAs against the Ivy Leagues to claim another National Title, and eventually qualify for the 1936 Olympics. 
        This chance to go the Olympics eventually allowed a boat full of college kids from the University of Washington to defeat 
        the Germans in the grandfinal of the 1936 Berlin Olympics for the Gold medal in audience of thousands of German people, 
        Adolf Hitler, and Joseph Goebbels. The story of these boys is still extremly important to todays boathouse culture at UW and 
        will continue to be far into the future. It was made famous to the public by James Brown in his 2013 bestseller, <i> Boys in the Boat</i>
